# create a programm that takes IP address entered at the keyboard
# and prints out the number of segments it contains,and the length of each segment
#  An IP Address consists of 4 numbers,seperated from each other with a full stop.But your program should just count many are entered
# Exampel of the input you may get are:
# 127.0.0.1
# .192.168.0.1
# 10.0.123456.255
# 172.16
# # 255
# so your program should work even with Invalid ip Addresses.We are just interested in the number of segments and how long each one is.
# once your have a working program ,here are some more for invalid input to test:
#     .123.45.678.91
#     123.4567.8.9.
#     123.156.289.10123456
#     10.10t.10.10
#     12.9.34.6.12.90
#     ''_that is ,press enter without typing anything
